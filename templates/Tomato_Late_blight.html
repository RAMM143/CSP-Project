      <ul class="para">
         <li><b>Symptoms:</b> The disease initially appears as dark, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, typically starting at the edges. As the infection progresses, the lesions turn brown or black and may have a fuzzy or moldy appearance. The affected leaves can quickly collapse and die. Infected fruits may also develop dark, firm lesions.</li>
         <li><b>Disease development:</b> Late Blight thrives in cool, wet conditions. The pathogen spreads rapidly through spores, which are easily dispersed by wind, rain, or mechanical means. The disease can affect all above-ground parts of the tomato plant, including leaves, stems, and fruits.</li>
         <li><b>Impact on yield:</b> Late Blight can cause significant yield losses by rapidly defoliating the plant and rotting the fruits. The disease can lead to a complete crop failure if left uncontrolled.</li>

        <p class="para">Tomato Late Blight, also known as Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating fungal disease that affects tomato plants. It is the same pathogen responsible for the infamous Irish potato famine. Late Blight can cause significant damage to tomato crops if not managed properly.</p>
        <p class="imp"><b>Note:Scientific Name of Tomato Late Blight is</b><i><b> Phytophthora infestans (Montagne) Bary ( ITIS ) </b></i>

        <center><b><u><h1 class="iden"style="font-size: 40px; color:#A52A2A">Preventive Measures</h1></b></u></center>
        <p class="para">Managing Tomato Late Blight involves a combination of cultural, genetic, and chemical control measures. Here are some strategies:</p>
        <p class="para"><br><b>Resistant varieties</b> Planting tomato varieties that have genetic resistance to Late Blight is a highly effective strategy. Look for varieties with the letters "LB" (Late Blight resistant) listed in their names or consult with local agricultural extension services for recommendations.<br>

          <br><b>Cultural practices :</b> Promote good air circulation and reduce humidity by spacing tomato plants adequately. Avoid overhead irrigation and water the plants at the base to minimize leaf wetness. Regularly remove and destroy any infected plant debris to reduce the source of inoculum.<br>
          
          <br><b>Fungicide applications :</b> Fungicides can be used to manage Late Blight when disease pressure is high or when resistant varieties are not available or insufficient. Fungicides containing active ingredients such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based fungicides can help control the disease. Follow label instructions and recommended application schedules, especially during periods of cool, wet weather.<br>
          
          <br><b>Early detection and action :</b> Regularly monitor tomato plants for signs of Late Blight. If detected, take immediate action by removing and destroying infected plant parts. This helps prevent further spread of the disease.<br>

            <tr>
              <th><u><b><h2>CULTURAL CONTROL</h2></u></b></th>
              <th><u><b><h2>CHEMICAL CONTROL</h2></u></b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Resistant varieties :</b> Plant tomato varieties that are known to have some level of resistance to Late Blight. Look for varieties labeled as resistant or tolerant to Late Blight when selecting your seeds or seedlings. Resistant varieties can help reduce the severity of the disease.</td>
              <td><b>Copper-based fungicides :</b> Copper-based fungicides, such as copper hydroxide or copper oxychloride, can be effective against Tomato Late Blight. These fungicides have a protective action and are typically applied as foliar sprays. They help to suppress the spread of the disease and protect healthy plant tissues.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Crop rotation :</b> Implement a crop rotation system by avoiding planting tomatoes or other susceptible plants in the same location for consecutive years. Rotate with non-host crops, such as legumes or grains, to help disrupt the disease cycle and reduce pathogen buildup in the soil.</td>
              <td><b>Mancozeb:</b> Mancozeb is a broad-spectrum fungicide that can provide control of Tomato Late Blight. It is often used as a tank mix partner with other fungicides to enhance disease control and manage resistance. Mancozeb works by inhibiting fungal growth and spore germination.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Sanitation :</b> Practice good garden sanitation by removing and destroying any infected plant debris, including infected tomato plants, leaves, and fruits. Do not compost infected plant material, as the spores can survive and spread. Proper disposal helps reduce the potential for overwintering and reinfection.</td>
              <td><b>Chlorothalonil:</b> Chlorothalonil is another fungicide commonly used for Tomato Late Blight control. It has a protective action and can be effective in managing the disease. It is typically applied as a foliar spray and provides good coverage on plant surfaces.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Proper plant spacing :</b> Provide adequate spacing between tomato plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity levels around the foliage. This can help inhibit the spread and development of the disease.</b></td>
              <td><b>Fluazinam:</b> Fluazinam is a systemic fungicide that can provide control of Tomato Late Blight. It is absorbed by the plant and helps to prevent the spread of the disease within the plant tissues. Fluazinam is usually applied as a foliar spray.</td>
            </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Mulching :</b> Apply organic mulch, such as straw or compost, around the base of tomato plants. Mulching helps reduce soil splashing, which can carry fungal spores onto the plants.</td>
            <td><b>Azoxystrobin:</b> Azoxystrobin is a strobilurin fungicide that can be effective against Tomato Late Blight. It has both protective and curative properties, helping to control the disease and reduce its spread. Azoxystrobin is typically applied as a foliar spray.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Beneficial microorganisms :</b> Apply beneficial microorganisms, such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma species, as a foliar spray or soil drench. These organisms can help suppress the growth of the Late Blight pathogen.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Copper-based fungicides :</b> Copper-based fungicides, approved for organic gardening, can provide some control of Late Blight. These products form a protective barrier on the plant's surface, inhibiting spore germination and penetration. Follow the label instructions for proper application rates and timing.</td>
            
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Biofungicides:</b> Biofungicides containing natural ingredients, such as Bacillus species or extracts from neem or garlic, may help suppress Late Blight. These products work by interfering with the pathogen's growth and development.</td>
            
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Regular monitoring:</b> Monitor your tomato plants closely for signs of Late Blight. Early detection is crucial for effective control. If symptoms appear, take immediate action to remove and destroy infected plant parts to prevent further spread.</td>
            
          </tr>
