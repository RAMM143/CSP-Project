<li><b>Symptoms:</b> Tomato plants infected with Tomato mosaic virus display a variety of symptoms. These can include mosaic-like patterns of light and dark green color on the leaves, curling or distortion of leaves, stunted growth, and reduced fruit yield and quality. Fruits may also show yellow or green mottling, uneven ripening, or necrotic spots.

</li><li><b>Disease transmission:</b> Tomato mosaic virus can spread through direct contact between infected and healthy plants. It can also be transmitted by mechanical means, such as through contaminated tools, hands, or clothing. In addition, the virus can be carried by insects, including aphids and whiteflies, which can transfer it from infected plants to healthy ones.

</li><li><b>Favorable conditions:</b> Tomato mosaic virus thrives under warm temperatures, typically between 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). The virus can persist in plant debris, soil, and infected seeds, allowing it to survive from one growing season to the next.

        <p class="para">Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a common viral disease that affects tomato plants. It is caused by the Tomato mosaic virus, which belongs to the genus Tobamovirus. This virus infects a wide range of tomato varieties and can lead to significant crop losses if not properly managed.

          <br><b>There is no cure for Tomato mosaic virus, so prevention and management are key. Here are some strategies:</b>

          <br><b>Planting virus-free seedlings:</b> Start with healthy, virus-free seedlings obtained from reputable sources.
          <br><b>Sanitation:</b> Practice good sanitation by removing and destroying any infected plant material, including weeds, debris, and volunteer tomato plants.
          <br><b>Insect control:</b> Manage insect vectors, such as aphids and whiteflies, through appropriate insecticide applications or the use of physical barriers.
          <br><b>Hand hygiene:</b> Maintain good hand hygiene and use sanitized tools and equipment to minimize the risk of mechanical transmission.
          <br><b> Resistant varieties:</b> Consider planting tomato varieties that are resistant or tolerant to Tomato mosaic virus. These varieties can help reduce the severity of the disease.
          <br><b>Crop rotation:</b> Rotate tomato crops with non-susceptible plants to break the disease cycle and reduce virus inoculum in the soil.
